{"prompt": "What is the simple interest on $500 at 4% for 2 years?", "completion": "Step 1: Use the formula SI = P × R × T / 100. Step 2: SI = 500 × 4 × 2 / 100 = $40. Final Answer: $40"}
{"prompt": "How do you calculate the compound interest on $1000 at 5% annual interest for 3 years?", "completion": "Step 1: Use CI = P(1 + r)^t - P. Step 2: CI = 1000(1 + 0.05)^3 - 1000 = $157.63. Final Answer: $157.63"}
{"prompt": "What is the monthly payment on a $20,000 loan at 6% annual interest over 5 years?", "completion": "Step 1: Use loan payment formula: M = P × r(1+r)^n / ((1+r)^n - 1). Step 2: Monthly rate r = 0.06 / 12 = 0.005. n = 60. Step 3: Calculate M ≈ $386.66. Final Answer: $386.66"}
{"prompt": "How do you calculate Net Present Value (NPV)?", "completion": "Step 1: NPV = Σ (Ct / (1 + r)^t) - C0. Step 2: Ct = cash inflows, r = discount rate, t = time, C0 = initial investment. Step 3: Plug in values to compute. Final Answer: NPV = Present Value of inflows - Initial Cost"}
{"prompt": "What is the simple interest on $500 at 4% for 3 years?", "completion": "Step 1: Use the formula SI = P × R × T / 100.\nStep 2: SI = 500 × 4 × 3 / 100 = $60.\nFinal Answer: $60"}
{"prompt": "What is the future value of $1,000 invested at 8% annual interest for 4 years?", "completion": "Step 1: Use the formula FV = P × (1 + r)^t.\nStep 2: FV = 1000 × (1 + 0.08)^4 = 1000 × 1.36049 = $1360.49.\nFinal Answer: $1360.49"}
{"prompt": "How do you calculate the total amount repaid on a simple interest loan of $1500 at 6% for 3 years?", "completion": "Step 1: Find interest: SI = P × R × T / 100 = 1500 × 6 × 3 / 100 = $270.\nStep 2: Total repayment = Principal + Interest = 1500 + 270 = $1770.\nFinal Answer: $1770"}
{"prompt": "What is the effective annual rate (EAR) if the nominal rate is 10% compounded quarterly?", "completion": "Step 1: Use EAR = (1 + r/n)^n - 1, where r = 0.10, n = 4.\nStep 2: EAR = (1 + 0.10/4)^4 - 1 = 1.025^4 - 1 ≈ 0.1038.\nFinal Answer: 10.38%"}
{"prompt": "How do you calculate the present value of $2000 received 3 years from now at a 7% discount rate?", "completion": "Step 1: Use PV = FV / (1 + r)^t.\nStep 2: PV = 2000 / (1 + 0.07)^3 = 2000 / 1.225043 ≈ $1632.33.\nFinal Answer: $1632.33"}
{"prompt": "What is the compound interest on $5000 at 5% annual interest compounded yearly for 2 years?", "completion": "Step 1: Use CI = P(1 + r)^t - P.\nStep 2: CI = 5000(1 + 0.05)^2 - 5000 = 5000 × 1.1025 - 5000 = $552.50.\nFinal Answer: $552.50"}
