# Finance-Math-with-LLM
an AI powered app designed to help solve finance math. A first stage of the app.
Finance Math App is my first project with LLM. It is an interactive web app that explains financial math problems step by step. Built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and powered by a lightweight large language model (LLM), it also includes real-time stock price tracking using Yahoo Finance.
