# Finance-Math-with-LLM
an AI powered app designed to help solve finance math. A first stage of the app.
Finance Math App is my first project with LLM. It is an interactive web app that explains financial math problems step by step. Built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and powered by a lightweight large language model (LLM), it also includes real-time stock price tracking using Yahoo Finance.

**Tech Stack**

- Language: Python
- Streamlit : Frontend interface  
- Hugging Face Transformers: LLM backbone  
- Torch: Inference backend  
- yfinance :Stock price data

**Files description**:
- app.y contian the frontend code.
- finmath_model.py contains the logic for loading the LLM and generating step-by-step answers to financial math questions.

- fine_tune.py is the model tuning code.
- fine_date.jsonl is the dataset.
- Finance_formular to use Python to make arithmetic operations


It's a work under progress and I will update the improved version by time. I'm working on improving answer accuracy, adding PDF/CSV uploads for batch questions, and fine-tuning the model on a larger finance-specific dataset, etc. I welcome you to use my code as a baseline for your project.
